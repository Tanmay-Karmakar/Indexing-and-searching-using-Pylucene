# Indexing-and-searching-using-Pylucene
Pylucene is a lucene wrapper for python broadly used in Information Retrival. I have implemented indexing and searching using **Maximum Value Decomposition** as a IR project in ISI Kolkata taught by Prof. Debapriyo Majumdar. The dataset used is **trec678rb:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qkzLYnz7NiE4KeqO9ZQ2YGtSB9QBcL1/view?usp=sharing . One needs to set the approbriate paths to run. First run **myIndexer.py** for indexing the dataset then run **mySearcher.py** to get the ranked documents. The parameters are set emperically, ideally one needs to examine the data to estimate the parameters.
